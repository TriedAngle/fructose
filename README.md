  <strong> Mathematical Traits </strong> for the <strong>Glucose Library</strong> and the Rust programming language.

#### Notes: 
* Rust 1.51 (nightly only right now) and onwards is required

* For planned and current features see TODO.md

* Why didn't you use crate X instead of writing Y yourself?  
  Because I decided not to ;)

* this project is under heavy development and not really usable from a consumer-perspective 
  right now. Expect many breaking updates as architecture and features are not decided yet.
  
  
#### Credit

* num-traits
* ndarry
* maths-traits
